## Requirements

Strapi v4 is required.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save strapi-plugin-shopify
```

## Middlewares configuration

Webhooks are authenticated with **HMAC** calculated on the raw body, `strapi::body` middleware should be configured to pass the unparsed body as following:

```js
{
  name: 'strapi::body',
  config: {
    includeUnparsed: true,
  },
},
```

If you want to serve an embedded app directly from Strapi you will find that default **CSP policies** will not allow to do that, `strapi::security` middleware should be configured as following *(this configuration should be used only if you have problem with the embedded app iframe)*:

```js
{
  name: 'strapi::security',
  config: {
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      useDefaults: true,
      directives: {
        'frame-ancestors': null,
      },
    },
    frameguard: false,
  },
},
```

## Shopify Configuration

The Shopify application should be configured as follow:
- App URL should be set as `https://your-domain.com/api/shopify`
- Allowed redirection URL(s) should have both
  - `https://your-domain.com/api/shopify/install/callback`
  - `https://your-domain.com/api/shopify/auth/callback`
